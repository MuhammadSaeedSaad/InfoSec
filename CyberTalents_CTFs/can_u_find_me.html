1- how can i know the compression type of that file?
we can identify the header of the file. every compression method has a unique header. or u can simply use the "file" linux command.

useful links:
- compression methods headers
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19120676/how-to-detect-type-of-compression-used-on-the-file-if-no-file-extension-is-spe
- python script that takes the compressed file and its input and then decompresses it depending on its type.

2- after using "file" we find out that the compression is from type ARCH which we can decompress using "nomarch" package in linux.
try to install it using the "apt install nomarch" but didn't work for the first time as my cache was not up-to-date 
so i tried "apt update". the i repeated the "apt install nomarch" and it worked. 
then i decompressed the ARCH file with nomarch "nomarch f100" and the output was a PPMD compressed file.
